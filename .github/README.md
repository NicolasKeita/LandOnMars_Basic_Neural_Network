# Rocket landing, AI spin-off : Genetic Algorithm

This GitHub repository addresses the classic Rocket Landing trajectory **optimization** problem,   
enriching the challenge with additional complexities, including: 
- **Landscapes:** Navigate through varying terrains such as mountains, hollows, and tunnels.
- **Time Constraint:** Solve the optimization problem within a rigorously defined time limit.  
(This is why I've opted for a Genetic Algorithm approach rather than Reinforcement Learning)
